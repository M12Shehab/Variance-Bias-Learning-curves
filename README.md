# Diagnosing Bias and Variance using Learning Curves

## Overview
This tutorial focuses on diagnosing bias and variance in machine learning models using learning curves. It provides a comprehensive understanding of these key concepts and their impact on model performance.

## Objective
The primary objective of this project is to demonstrate how to analyze learning curves for both training and cross-validation datasets to diagnose bias and variance issues in machine learning models.

## Key Concepts
- **High Bias**: A model exhibits high bias if the gap between the training and cross-validation curves is significant, indicating underfitting.
- **High Variance**: A model exhibits high variance if the gap between the training and cross-validation curves is small, even with increased data size, indicating overfitting.
- **Optimal Model Complexity**: An optimal model complexity is achieved when the training and cross-validation curves intersect, indicating a well-balanced model.
